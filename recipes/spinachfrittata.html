    <h2><strong> A flavorful spinach frittata, featuring a blend of parmesan cheese and onions, infused with the fragrant notes of thyme</strong></h2>
    <p>This spinach frittata is a wonderfully simple dish that effortlessly delivers a delicious, visually appealing, and substantive meal. Its crowd-pleasing flavor profile, coupled with its versatility, cement its status as a go-to option in my recipe arsenal.</p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/2 cup parmesan - grated</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion - diced </li>
        <li>1 (5 0z) bag fresh baby spinach leaves - finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 400Â°F. Place an ungreased ceramic or glass 9-inch pie plate in the preheating oven, allowing it to preheat with the oven.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the eggs with kosher salt, black pepper, garlic powder, dried thyme, and red pepper flakes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the parmesan and the chopped onion. Then stir in the spinach in batches.</li>
        <li>Using oven mitts, pull the hot pie plate out of the oven and place it on a trivet. Lightly grease the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg and spinach mixture into the hot pie plate. Use a rubber spatula to smooth out the top. It will seem like a lot of spinach relative to the eggs but remember that spinach wilts as it cooks.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the oven. Bake the frittata until it's puffed, and a toothpick inserted in its center comes out clean, 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool the frittata for 15 minutes in the pan before slicing it into eight triangles and serving.</li>
    </ol>
